                <p>
                    Judging will take place over several weeks following the game jam, as submissions are adapted and verified for use with BCI systems and provided to the children for judging.
                    All participants will receive an invite with details on how to join the Winner Announcement Event once winners are chosen!
                    Details of this event will be posted here as well as on our Discord channel - keep an eye out!
