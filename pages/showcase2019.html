                <h3>Game Jam 2019 Showcase</h3>
                <p>
                    In November 2019 we held the inaugural BCI Game Jam! 
                    We had 9 submissions from participants across North America.
                    Many of these brain-controlled games are actively being played and enjoyed by kids in the BCI4Kids program!
                </p>
