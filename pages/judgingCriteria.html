                <h3>Judging Criteria</h3>
                <p>
                    Your game will be judged by a panel of BCI experts, as well as a panel of children who use BCI regularly for gaming and entertainment. 
                    Here are some of the criteria your game will be judged on: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Theme</li>
                    <li>Concept</li>
                    <li>Creativity</li>
                    <li>BCI Integration</li>
                    <li>Accessibility</li>
                    <li>Graphics</li>
                    <li>Sound</li>
                    <li>Fun/Entertainment</li>
                    <li>Ease of Use/Setup</li>
                    <li>Ease of Play</li>
                    <li>Replayability</li>                 
                </ul>
                <h3>Submission Process</h3>
                <p>
                    We will create a personal submission link and folder that will be provided to teams at the start of the event.
                    In this submission folder we ask that you provide both a playable version of your game (executable), a couple screen shots of your game, and any special instructions in a text (or other) README file.
                    
                    In addition we are asking participants to provide the final submission <b style="color: #e704e6">source code</b> in a folder '/Source' in your drive link. We are only requesting the source code so we can effectively debug, polish, and verify the games are playable with BCI before giving them to the children judges.
                    To be clear - all developers participating in the game jam retain the <b style="color: #e704e6">sole, exclusive rights any and all IP/Games/Music/etc.</b> they submit as part of the BCI Game Jam competition.
                    We do request that participants either provide an appropriate license (CC0/CC-NC/CC-BY/etc.) or sign a waiver to let us non-commercially share your submission. This is for the purposes of judging, playing, and non-commercial use after the jam (e.g. with new children joining BCI programs across the country). <b style="color: #e704e6">NOTE! Teams unable to fulfill this requirement may not be eligible for the prizes as we rely on children to help select the winners</b>.
